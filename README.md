# Imperfect Harmony
 A downloader for the Harmontown podcast for paying members.
 
 # Use
 To use this, simply download this code, and run downloader.py after setting all your configs appropriately. Also, you need a valid Harmontown.com username and password for this script to run--even the free videos won't download without one, and it's only $5 for unlimited downloads, which with this script should be plenty of time to download all of it. 
 
 # Dependencies
 Just Python 3.7+
